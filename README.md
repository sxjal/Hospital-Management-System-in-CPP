# Hospital-Management-System-in-CPP

As the title being said, This is a full fledge hospital management system coded in C++. 

This was my highschool project in which I had to make a basic hospital management system. 
I had integrated almost everything I could during that time and it did consist of most of knowledge at that time. 

It includes features like managing all the patients, doctors, lab tests, medicines, etc,. 

It includes two type of login (Admin, User) and I had used binary files for storing information. 

It also has a cool loading screen which kinda looked cool so I had coded that for my project.

If you're new into programming and if you're are worried about how this code would work and all of that, chill-out. You do not need to worry on that part. 
Its quite simple, Just keep all the files in the same directory and that's a go.

Although, there might be a little bit of changes required if you're using a mac-os or Linux as few header files may or may not work with the same declaration, You might have to tweak them a little.
